* Chapter 2: Collecting 3D digital data on primate skulls
* Chapter 3: Using n-point alignment to approximate maximum intercuspation for digital crania and mandibles
* Chapter 4: Macroevolutionary correlates of primate skull shape
* Chapter 5: Macroevolutionary integration and modularity in the primate skull

All of the data required to run the code are part of this repo, including files for landmarks (TXT), phylogeny (NEX), and primate traits (CSV). The 3D surfaces (PLY format) from which landmarks were collected can be downloaded from [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/3D_surfaces_of_primate_skulls_from_my_dissertation_Macroevolution_of_primate_skull_shape_combining_geometric_morphometrics_and_phylogenetic_comparative_methods_/5971231/1).
